  theory: `
    Titration is a quantitative analytical method used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration. In this experiment, we use oxalic acid as a primary standard to determine the exact concentration of sodium hydroxide solution.

    The reaction involved is:
    H₂C₂O₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂C₂O₄ + 2H₂O

    Oxalic acid is diprotic (can donate 2 H⁺ ions), so 1 mole of oxalic acid reacts with 2 moles of NaOH.
    
    The endpoint is detected using phenolphthalein indicator, which changes from colorless to pink in basic solution.

  safetyInfo: "Sodium hydroxide is highly corrosive and can cause severe burns. Oxalic acid is toxic if ingested and can cause irritation. Always wear safety goggles and gloves. Handle all chemicals with care and wash hands thoroughly after the experiment. Work in a well-ventilated area."
