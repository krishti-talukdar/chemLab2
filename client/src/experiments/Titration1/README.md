# Titration 1: NaOH Standardization

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the standardization of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution using oxalic acid as a primary standard. Students learn precise volumetric analysis techniques and endpoint detection methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Master the technique of acid-base titration
- Understand the concept of primary and secondary standards
- Learn accurate endpoint detection using indicators
- Calculate normality and strength of unknown solutions
- Practice precise volumetric measurements

## Equipment Required

### Glassware
- **Burette (50 mL)**: For precise delivery of NaOH solution
- **Pipette (25 mL)**: For accurate measurement of oxalic acid
- **Conical Flask (250 mL)**: Reaction vessel for titration
- **Funnel**: For safe transfer of solutions
- **Wash Bottle**: For rinsing equipment with distilled water

### Additional Equipment
- Burette stand with clamp
- White tile (for better endpoint visibility)
- Beaker (100 mL) for solution preparation

## Chemicals & Solutions

### Standard Solutions
- **0.1N Oxalic Acid (H₂C₂O₄)**: Primary standard solution
- **NaOH Solution**: Unknown concentration (to be determined)
- **Distilled Water**: For rinsing and dilution

### Indicator
- **Phenolphthalein**: Color change indicator (colorless → pink)

## Chemical Reaction
```
H₂C₂O₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂C₂O₄ + 2H₂O
```

## Procedure Summary

1. **Workspace Setup**: Arrange all equipment systematically
2. **Burette Preparation**: Rinse and fill with NaOH solution
3. **Sample Preparation**: Transfer 25.0 mL oxalic acid to conical flask
4. **Add Indicator**: 2-3 drops of phenolphthalein
5. **Titration**: Add NaOH dropwise until pink endpoint
6. **Record Data**: Note burette readings and calculate titre
7. **Repeat**: Perform concordant titrations for accuracy
8. **Calculate Results**: Determine NaOH normality and strength

## Calculations

### Normality Formula
```
N₁V₁ = N₂V₂
```
Where:
- N₁ = Normality of oxalic acid (0.1N)
- V₁ = Volume of oxalic acid (25.0 mL)
- N₂ = Normality of NaOH (unknown)
- V₂ = Volume of NaOH used (from titration)

### Strength Calculation
```
Strength (g/L) = Normality × Equivalent Weight
```
For NaOH: Equivalent Weight = 40 g/mol

## Safety Precautions

⚠️ **Important Safety Guidelines:**
- Wear safety goggles and gloves at all times
- NaOH is highly corrosive - handle with extreme care
- Oxalic acid is toxic - avoid skin contact and inhalation
- Work in well-ventilated area
- Keep wash bottle ready for emergency rinsing
- Report spills immediately
- Wash hands thoroughly after experiment

## Expected Results
- Typical titre volumes: 20-30 mL (depending on NaOH concentration)
- Concordant results should agree within ±0.1 mL
- Pink endpoint should persist for 30 seconds

## Common Sources of Error
- Parallax error in reading burette
- Overshooting the endpoint
- Air bubbles in burette tip
- Contaminated glassware
- Improper indicator amount

## Educational Value
This experiment teaches fundamental quantitative analysis skills essential for analytical chemistry, quality control, and research applications.
