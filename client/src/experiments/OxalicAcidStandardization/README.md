# Preparation of Standard Solution of Oxalic Acid

## Overview

This virtual laboratory experiment teaches students how to prepare a standard solution of oxalic acid dihydrate (H₂C₂O₄·2H₂O) with accurate concentration. This is a fundamental technique in quantitative analytical chemistry.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn to calculate the mass of solute required for a specific molarity
- Master the use of analytical balance for precise weighing
- Understand proper volumetric flask usage and technique
- Practice solution preparation with accurate concentration control
- Apply principles of quantitative analysis

## Chemical Information

### Oxalic Acid Dihydrate (H₂C₂O₄·2H₂O)
- **Molecular Weight:** 126.07 g/mol
- **Appearance:** White crystalline solid
- **Solubility:** Highly soluble in water
- **Properties:** Diprotic acid, strong reducing agent

## Experimental Procedure

### Step 1: Mass Calculation
Calculate the exact mass of oxalic acid dihydrate needed using the formula:
```
mass = Molarity × Volume (L) × Molecular Weight
```

### Step 2: Precise Weighing
- Use analytical balance for accurate measurement
- Record exact mass to 4 decimal places
- Handle chemicals with appropriate safety measures

### Step 3: Initial Dissolution
- Transfer weighed solid to beaker
- Add distilled water (about 50 mL)
- Stir until completely dissolved

### Step 4: Volumetric Transfer
- Use funnel to transfer solution to volumetric flask
- Rinse beaker and funnel with distilled water
- Add rinse water to flask

### Step 5: Volume Adjustment
- Add distilled water until near the graduation mark
- Leave 2-3 cm below the mark initially
- Swirl gently to mix

### Step 6: Final Volume
- Use dropper for final volume adjustment
- Add water drop by drop to reach the mark
- Align bottom of meniscus with graduation line

### Step 7: Complete Mixing
- Cap the volumetric flask securely
- Invert 20-25 times for thorough mixing
- Calculate final exact molarity

## Safety Considerations

- **Toxicity:** Oxalic acid is toxic if ingested
- **Corrosivity:** Can cause skin and eye irritation
- **Protective Equipment:** Wear safety goggles and gloves
- **Ventilation:** Work in well-ventilated area
- **Disposal:** Follow proper chemical disposal procedures

## Key Formulas

### Molarity Calculation
```
M = n/V
where: M = molarity, n = moles, V = volume (L)
```

### Moles Calculation
```
n = m/MW
where: n = moles, m = mass (g), MW = molecular weight (g/mol)
```

### Combined Formula
```
M = (m/MW)/V = m/(MW × V)
```

## Expected Results

For a properly prepared 0.1 M solution in 250 mL:
- **Required mass:** 3.1518 g
- **Final molarity:** ~0.1000 M (±0.001 M)
- **Percent error:** <1% for accurate technique

## Common Errors

1. **Weighing errors:** Inaccurate balance readings
2. **Transfer losses:** Incomplete transfer of solution
3. **Volume errors:** Incorrect meniscus reading
4. **Dissolution issues:** Incomplete dissolving before transfer
5. **Mixing problems:** Inadequate final mixing

## Applications

Standard oxalic acid solutions are used for:
- Redox titrations (permanganate standardization)
- Calcium determination (precipitation methods)
- Metal complex formation studies
- Analytical method development

## Quality Control

- **Accuracy check:** Compare calculated vs. target molarity
- **Precision test:** Repeat preparation multiple times
- **Purity verification:** Use high-grade chemicals
- **Equipment calibration:** Verify balance and glassware
